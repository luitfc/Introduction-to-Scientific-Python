    "* Easy to learn and quick to program in - more time on scientific thinking, less time on programming. Note that our main work is research.\n",
    "* Dynamically-typed and automatic memory management - No need to define types for variables and functions. No need to manually allocate and deallocate memory for data arrays \n",
